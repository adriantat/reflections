When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 	When I want to work with others, or make sure my code is safe (which means save in the cloud)
 Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 	If automatically stay up-to-date, some unwanted changes may happen and makes me not clear about what I am actually dealing with.
